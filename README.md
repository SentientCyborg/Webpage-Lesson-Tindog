# Webpage-Lesson-Tindog
This is the finished project for Day 58 of the Udemy course [100 Days of Code by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  

Includes the site both before and after refactor. The lesson itself is somewhat outdated, so I am hoping that posting the final solution might be helpful to 
anyone stuggling to follow the instructor. 

This version of the "tindog" page uses Bootstrap Icons instead of the FontAwesome icons the instructor used. FontAwesome has changed since the lesson was 
originally published and their icons are no longer available without creating an account. I used the Bootstrap icons because they not require an account. 

Portions of the lesson were coding challenges, so some of the code includes some class names and stucture that deviates from the insturctor's lesson, but the
deviations are not significant.
